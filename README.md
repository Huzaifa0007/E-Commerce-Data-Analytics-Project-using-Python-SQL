<h3>Whatâ€™s This About?</h3>
<p>In this project, I combined Python and SQL to analyze e-commerce sales data, find patterns in customer behavior, and understand product performance.</p>
<p>The aim was to get a complete picture from database queries to advanced Python visualizations of how the business is performing and where improvements can be made.</p>

<h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
